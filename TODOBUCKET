Refactor to make use of Eigen matrix operations?
Add a zip function in <linc/util.h++> that makes raw-loops prettier?

If we need more performance later:
  - sort vertices based on z, y, x, in that order instead of x, y, z like we do now
    that would speed up MeshClipper::setDistances by more than 50% since we could
    check the special cases all/none visible with one comparison each (look at first/last element),
    and use binary search to find the index of the last visible point.
  - Merge Mesh and MeshClipper into one class.
    Or keep only Mesh, and put the special MeshClipper book-keeping variables (m_distance, m_visisble etc)
    into vectors that live inside the softClip function
