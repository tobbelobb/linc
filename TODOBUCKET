Refactor to make use of Eigen matrix operations?

If we need more performance later:
  - sort vertices based on z, y, x, in that order instead of x, y, z like we do now
    that would speed up MeshClipper::setDistances by more than 50% since we could
    check the special cases all/none visible with one comparison each (look at first/last element),
    and use binary search to find the index of the last visible point.
  - Use Halide?

If user doesn't want the hull algorithm to be used:
  - don't sort ccw. Use the walls already in the model to
    determine the order of the top points
